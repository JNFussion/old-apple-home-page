This project is from [The odin project HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients).

The goal is to recreate an old [apple home page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140228164946/http://www.apple.com/) in order to practise the use of background images and gradients. <br>
Buttons and links don't work. It needs media queries to adapt the layout to smaller screens.

**UPDATE:** Google has flagged the page as phishing. I have added a disclaimer to make it clear that is a mockup.
